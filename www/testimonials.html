		<p>Working at Principal is a great pleasure for me. The thing I appreciate most about the company is that it has given me the opportunity to balance work and life by allowing flexible hours working. I manage to contribute to the company and still have time for my family. Principal also gives me the opportunity to work in a pleasant multicultural environment with supportive colleagues. The management team is very good in making sure that the suggestions and opinions of employees are included in the company planning process. I am proud to be part of Principal!</p>
